# UI Components Gallery

## Quick History

We started this project with the intuit to create a UI "pattern library" to allow our team to document and collect design/front-end development artifacts in general.

Along the way, after long debates with designers, researchers and developers, we feel that it's best to stay away from the term "Pattern" simply because it conveys different meaning to each user-segment we intend target. Therefore, the term "component" is more appropriate and inline with W3C's current "Web Components" specification to build custom/reusable elements.  



## Development Specification

The initial app was created from an [early demo](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) by AngularJS team.

The following framework and libraries were used to develop this system:

- AngularJS v1.2.0 
- Bootstrap v3.0 (CSS and JS)
- Less v1.4.1

## Roadmap

- **Database integration**

	- good candidate at this point is CouchDB [article](http://mircozeiss.com/sync-multiple-angularjs-apps-without-server-via-pouchdb/)
- **Github API integration**
	-  The idea here is to leverage GitHub as repository of UI components and allow users to register new components by simply entering the GitHub URL
- **Demo view**
	- allow users to add a demo vie using Plunker, JsFiddle or CodePen
